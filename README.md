# mercator_serie_semaphores
This C program calculates the Mercator series for ln(1 + x) using concurrent processes. The program utilizes shared memory and semaphores for synchronization between processes. It divides the work of calculating the series terms among multiple processes, each computing a portion of the series in parallel.
